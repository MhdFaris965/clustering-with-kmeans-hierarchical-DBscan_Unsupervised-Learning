# 🧠 Clustering with K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN

## 📄 Overview
This project explores **unsupervised machine learning techniques** for grouping unlabeled data using three popular clustering algorithms — **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN**.  
The notebook demonstrates how each algorithm works, how to apply them to datasets, and how to visualize and compare the resulting clusters.
