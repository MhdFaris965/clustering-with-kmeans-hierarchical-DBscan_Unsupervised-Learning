# clustering-with-kmeans-hierarchical-DBscan_Unsupervised-Learning
 This notebook demonstrates unsupervised learning techniques using K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualizations for cluster evaluation. The project helps compare how each algorithm groups data based on different parameters and distance metrics.
